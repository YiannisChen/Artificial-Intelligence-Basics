# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Experiment Repository

This repository is created to record the experiments conducted in the *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* course.

## 1. 8-Puzzle Solver

It is an 8-puzzle solver that uses **BFS, DFS, and A*** algorithms to find solutions. Users can:  
- Shuffle the puzzle  
- Solve it using different algorithms  
- Upload a custom background image for the puzzle  

## 2. Gobang AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project implements a **Gobang game** with an AI opponent. The AI uses the **Negamax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** to optimize its move selection. The project is based on the algorithm from [colingogogo](https://github.com/colingogogo), with some modifications for learning purposes.

## 3. Decision Tree Entropy and Classification

This project implements a **decision tree classifier** using the `sklearn` library, focusing on entropy calculation as a key part of decision tree algorithms like **ID3**. It demonstrates:
- How to preprocess a dataset  
- Training a decision tree model  
- Computing the **information entropy** of the datasetâ€™s classification labels  

## 4. Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a **neural network** for recognizing handwritten digits from a dataset. The network is designed with adjustable parameters to explore their effects on model performance. Experiments include:
- Varying learning rates  
- Changing hidden layer sizes  
- Adjusting the number of epochs  
- Using different dataset sizes
