# 8-Puzzle Solver

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) program to solve the 8-puzzle problem using BFS (Breadth-First Search) and A* (A-star) algorithms. The puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered 1-8 and an empty space represented by 0. The goal is to arrange the tiles in ascending order with the empty space in the last position.

## Features

- Shuffle: Randomly shuffle the puzzle tiles.
- BFS Solve: Solve the puzzle using the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- A* Solve: Solve the puzzle using the A* algorithm with Manhattan distance as the heuristic.
- Reset: Reset the puzzle to its initial state.
- Upload Background: Upload a custom background image for the tiles.
