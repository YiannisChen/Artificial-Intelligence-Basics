1. 8-Puzzle Solver
This is an 8-puzzle solver that uses BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms to find solutions. Users can shuffle the puzzle, solve it using different algorithms, and upload a custom background image for the puzzle.

2. Gobang AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning
This project implements a Gobang (Five-in-a-Row) game with an AI opponent. The AI uses the Negamax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize its move selection. The project is based on the algorithm from colingogogo（https://github.com/colingogogo）, with some modifications for learning purposes.

Future updates will include additional projects and homework, numbered in sequence.
