This repository is created to record the experiments conducted in the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course
1. 8-Puzzle Solver
   
It is an 8-puzzle solver that uses BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms to find solutions. Users can shuffle the puzzle, solve it using different algorithms, and upload a custom background image for the puzzle.

2. Gobang AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning

It implements a Gobang game with an AI opponent. The AI uses the Negamax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize its move selection. The project is based on the algorithm from colingogogo（https://github.com/colingogogo）, with some modifications for learning purposes.

3. Decision Tree Entropy and Classification

This project implements a decision tree classifier using the `sklearn` library, with a focus on calculating entropy as a key part of decision tree algorithms like ID3. It also demonstrates how to preprocess a dataset, train a decision tree model, and compute the information entropy of the dataset’s classification labels.

4. Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits from the dataset. The neural network is designed with adjustable parameters to explore the effects of different parameters on model performance. It allows for experiments with varying learning rates, hidden layer sizes, number of epochs, and dataset sizes.
