# 8-Puzzle Solver

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) program to solve the 8-puzzle problem using BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and A* algorithms. The puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered 1-8 and an empty space represented by 0. The goal is to arrange the tiles in ascending order with the empty space in the last position.

## Features

- **Shuffle:** Randomly shuffle the puzzle tiles.
- **Solve with BFS:** Solve the puzzle using the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- **Solve with DFS:** Solve the puzzle using the Depth-First Search algorithm.
- **Solve with A\*:** Solve the puzzle using the A\* algorithm with Manhattan distance as the heuristic.
- **Reset:** Reset the puzzle to its initial state.
- **Upload Background:** Upload a custom background image for the tiles.
- **Run All Algorithms:** Run all three algorithms (BFS, DFS, and A\*) and compare their performance in terms of time and steps.
