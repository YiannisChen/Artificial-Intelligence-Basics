# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Experiment Repository

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repo is a collection of my AI course experiments and classic projects. Here's a quick tour of what's inside:

## Classic AI Games & Algorithms (`Intro-to-AI/`)
- 8-Puzzle solver (BFS, DFS, A*)
- Gobang (Five-in-a-row) with a simple AI
- Decision tree classifier (entropy, ID3)
- A basic neural net for digit recognition

## Machine Learning Assignments (`Machine-Learning/`)
- **Regression**: Linear and logistic regression, with cool plots for learning rates and convergence
- **Digit Recognition**: Neural networks (including LeNet and a two-layer NN) on MNIST
- **SVM**: Support Vector Machines for classification tasks
- **Clustering**: K-means and DBSCAN clustering on toy datasets
